To-Do:
1) reformat older functions with newer tool functions
2) before starting...
  1) be able to move the planets around
  2) be able to change data values of planets
  3) be able to add planets at the start
  4) show and be able to change camPlan
  5) show the predicted trajectories as lines
5) show a faded out path behind planets as they move
6) make the planets look more like planets (maybe add gradient)
7) add a way to save planet configurations (and maybe a way to save multiple configurations)

Known Bugs:
1) collisions happening at the same time breaks things
