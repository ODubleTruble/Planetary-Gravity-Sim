To-Do:
1) add a button to reset the simulation
2) show the predicted trajectories as lines before starting
3) make the camera more fluid and less shaky/rigid
4) show a faded out path behind planets as they move
5) add a way to save planet configurations (and maybe a way to save multiple configurations)

Known Bugs:
1) auto-zoom isn't correct for a single planet (when there's 1 planet, zoom should be maxZoom)
