To-Do:
1) before starting...
  1) be able to add planets at the start
  2) show and be able to change camPlan
  3) show the predicted trajectories as lines
2) make the camera more fluid and less shaky/rigid
3) show a faded out path behind planets as they move
4) add a way to save planet configurations (and maybe a way to save multiple configurations)

Known Bugs:
1) auto-zoom isn't correct for a single planet (when there's 1 planet, zoom should be maxZoom)
2) updating camPlan from the html doesn't work yet
3) the entire visual section is currently just a placeholder
